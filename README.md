# Final project:

For my final project I made a web application for a herbologist friend of mine.
Within the application she has the ability to share her knowledge of plants in an herbarium.

She is also able to sell some flower artwork and infusions she makes through the small webshop.

## Framework

The backend was developed with the Symfony framework, also using easAdmin for the admin panel and API Platform.
A special library Vich Uploader was used to allow the upload of images...
